            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>YangLab, led by Dr. Guang Yang at Imperial College London, focuses on developing AI-driven techniques for imaging and biomedical data analysis with a strong emphasis on translational research. The lab’s work spans key areas such as AI-based data quality transfer, data harmonization, fast imaging, federated learning, and generative AI. These innovations are applied to tackle pre-clinical and clinical challenges in ageing, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and oncology, with a particular focus on drug discovery and clinical decision-making. YangLab is actively collaborating with academic and industrial partners to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and real-world healthcare solutions.</p>

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <p>YangLab does not currently offer internship opportunities or provide supervision for external remote students. Due to a high volume of emails on this topic, emails requesting internships or external supervision will go unanswered. For PhD applications, positions are typically advertised through Imperial College London’s official channels, and applicants should have a strong academic background, ideally with experience in AI, machine learning, or biomedical imaging. The lab values inclusivity, respect, and collaboration, and PhD students are encouraged to engage in independent research while benefiting from mentorship and career development support. Visiting researcher positions may be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the alignment of research interests and availability. For more information, please refer to the official Imperial College recruitment website.
